Lists are stored, essentially, as contiguous items in memory so that access can be as quick as possible.  However, they are mutable (they can be changed after they are created and stored) and so those mechanisms need to include extra functionality to deal with changing list sizes.\n",

        "## Tuple\n",

        "\n",
        "Before you start the exercises, run the code below.  It will generate the lists and tuple so that you can use them in the exercises.  If you need to recreate the lists again (because you have changed them and need to work on the originals, just run this cell again).\n",
        "\n",
        "***Note:***  *a list variable contains a reference to the start of the list in memory, rather than storing the list itself.
